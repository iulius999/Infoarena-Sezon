Hard algorithmic problem, given in 2021 for Romanian National Olympic Team Qualifications - 100/100 points C++ implementation

The statement of the problem can be found here: https://www.infoarena.ro/problema/sezon

My solution consists of high-level algorithmic concepts such as Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes in a tree, clever usage of unordered sets and input text file parsing.
